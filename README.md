## ✨ Features

✅ Upload and preprocess your own dataset  
✅ Filter by **Store** and **Item**  
✅ Visualize **sales trends** over time  
✅ Analyze **seasonality and trends** using decomposition  
✅ Perform **stationarity checks** (ADF Test, Rolling Stats)  
✅ Apply **SARIMA forecasting**  
✅ View **90-day forecasts** with confidence intervals  
✅ Intuitive **Streamlit dashboard interface**

📊 Project Overview
The Store Item Demand Forecasting App is designed to predict future item-level sales across multiple stores, aiding businesses in smarter inventory management and operational efficiency.

🎯 Problem Statement
The app forecasts demand for each store-item combination over a 90-day horizon, helping minimize stockouts and overstocking.

✅ Key Objectives
Preprocess and filter data by store and item
Perform time series decomposition to reveal trends and seasonality
Evaluate stationarity using Dickey-Fuller test
Apply multiple forecasting models and compare their performance
Visualize forecasts alongside confidence intervals

✨ Features
Interactive UI with Streamlit
Data Filtering by store and item

Time Series Analysis:
Seasonal decomposition
Rolling statistics and stationarity test (ADF)

Multiple Forecasting Models:
ARIMA
SARIMA (for seasonal patterns)
Exponential Smoothing
ARCH/GARCH (for modeling volatility)
LSTM (neural network-based deep learning model)

Visualizations:
Plotly-based interactive charts
Forecasts with confidence intervals
Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently

🚀 Usage

📦 Dataset
Expected CSV structure:


date	store	item	sales
01-01-2013	1	1	13
02-01-2013	1	1	11
date: Sales date in DD-MM-YYYY format

store: Store ID
item: Item ID
sales: Units sold
Sample dataset available on Kaggle: Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge

🧠 Methodology
🔧 Data Preprocessing
Convert date to datetime format
Extract features: day, month, year, day of week
Filter data by store and item

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Time series plots
Seasonal decomposition (additive model)
Rolling mean & std deviation
Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity

🧮 Forecasting Models
ARIMA: (5,1,0)
SARIMA: (1,1,1)(1,1,1,7)
Exponential Smoothing: Trend + Seasonality (365-day)
ARCH/GARCH: Model volatility in % returns
LSTM: Look-back window of 30 days

📈 Evaluation
